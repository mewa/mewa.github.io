      <description>Lately I have decided to take some time to work on my side-projects and make them useful for the broader public.
Inevitably, I bumped into a problem. Actually, not really a problem, but I had to implement a simple authentication scheme that at the same time wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an overkill.
I decided to use passwordless login and registration links because it seemed to fit my app just right and I wanted to have as little overhead as possible.</description>
